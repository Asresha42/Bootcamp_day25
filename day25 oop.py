# Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]

# 6.           Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
# yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
# amIOld()  should perform the following conditional actions:
# If , print You are young..
# If  and , print You are a teenager..
# Otherwise, print You are old..	
# Sample Input:
# 4
# -1
# 10
# 16
# 18
# Sample Output:
# Age is not valid, setting age to 0.
# You are young.
# You are young.

# You are a teenager.
